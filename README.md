# Wastewater INfluent Dynamics (WIND) Model
The WIND model generates total influent flow from (i) Base Wastewater Flow (BWF), (ii) Rainfall-Derived Inflow (RDI), and (iii) Infiltration. 
BWF is estimated based on population, per capita wastewater generation, and daily industrial discharge. 
RDI is modelled using a rainfall-runoff coefficient that quantifies the volume of direct inflow generated per unit rainfall over impervious surfaces. 
Infiltration is modelled using (i) reservoir method (Four calibration parameters) and (ii)the exponential delay method (Two calibration parameters). 
The WIND model can be applied both Separate Sewer Systems (SSSs) and Combined Sewer Systems (CSSs).
